    "How can you test this prompt template? Maybe you have some real-life values you can substitute in. But maybe you don't, or maybe you aren't allowed to test on the ones you do have for privacy reasons. No worries -- Claude can make them up! This cookbook demonstrates how to generate synthetic test data for your prompts using Claude & the Anthropic API. It includes functions for extracting variables from templates, constructing example blocks, generating test cases, and iteratively refining the results. The benefits of this are twofold:\n",
